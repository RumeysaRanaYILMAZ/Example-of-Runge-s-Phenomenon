# Example-of-Runge-s-Phenomenon


  For  (sin)^2 (4Ï€x) function with 10.degree interpolation with these support nodes below.
     
    First support points  ==>   [0 , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1 ]
  
  Change support points to  
  
    Second support points ==>   [0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.18, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.81, 0.9, 0.95, 1]
    

 to see whats happend to our interpolation function.
